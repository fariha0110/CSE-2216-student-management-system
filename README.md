# CSE-2216-student-management-system
SD-1 project
Project Description

This project is a simple Student Management System implemented in C++.
It allows users to add, search, update, delete, display, and count students efficiently.
The main objective is to manage student records in a structured way and store them into a file (students.txt) for persistence.

Objectives

To develop a menu-driven program for student record management.

To perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

To store and retrieve student data using file handling.


Technologies Used

Programming Language: C++

Libraries: Standard Template Library (STL) – via <bits/stdc++.h>

Compiler: g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)

IDE (optional): Visual Studio Code

Future Improvements

Add login system (username/password).

Use database (MySQL/SQLite) instead of text file.

Create a GUI version using Qt/JavaFX/Python Tkinter.
